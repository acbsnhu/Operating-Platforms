# Operating-Platforms

    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
      In this project we simulated working for a client by the name of The Gaming Room. They wanted us to help them develope a game that could be more accessiable to more usders across a wider market. Meaning they wanted to take their game draw it or lose it and move it from android to all other platforms if possible. They waanted a propsal with the requirments and possibilty of desgining a game through the web that more operating systems could use.
    
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
      I beleive i kept my facts and suggestions organized and got my point across for the client.
      
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
      I found being able to get a good understanding of what the client was looking for and what they wanted to accomplish would be very helpful in deveopling a code for their game.
      
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
      I would chose to revise the part that we worked on for the week 5 project. That was the section with tables and we had to fill in bullet points about each operating system and the benifits or weaknesses it had for each possible role. I would pick this area because i feel like I could of done a better job getting more facts and better details on which os would have been better for a server but not as a client to play the game on.
      
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
      I interpeted the users need to reach as many users a possible meanign they wanted to be on as many os's as possible. This made me easily suggest a linux server to run the game application. It is extreme important to consider the users needs when designing because you need to have a guideline to what will work for them and do it the way they want. You can spend weeks or even months on a project for a client/user and if you dont meet their needs then your just wasting there time and yours.
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
      I approached it with an open mind to what the client in this project wanted and did my best to narrow in on what they were asking. I think the best strategy i can use going forwward to do my best with analyzing or desgining an application would have to be to keep an open dialog and have good communication going back and forth from the client. This will allow me to have the most inisght into what they want so they i dont put time and effort into something that they may not even want.
